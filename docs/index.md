# CSAF

In this project the attempt is made, to provide API and tools to support the CSAF communities from a single repository in the easy to prototype python language.

If and when this endeavor succeeds, other langugaes can easily derive form the approach (as long as these offer similar capabilties to keep the effort in check).

CSAF versions 1.1 and 1.2 are out of scope.

## Status

Experimental.

**Note**: The default branch is `default`.
